Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package. 

By default, `make install' installs qvality and percolator commands under
`/usr/local/bin'.  You can specify an installation prefix other than 
`/usr/local' by giving`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

You can exclude percolator from the build and only build qvality by 
specifying the option `--disable-percolator', i.e.
./configure --disable-percolator

Debug information can be added to the code using the option `--enable-debug'

The command `./configure --help' print a summary of all the options to `configure'.
