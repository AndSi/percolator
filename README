BUILDING PERCOLATOR (from the latest snapshot or the repository)
The following instructions are for Linux Ubuntu.

Make, Cmake and a c++ compiler are required; the following libraries are also needed to build Percolator: libxerces-c-dev libboost-dev. The laterst version of Percolator includes a file type converter called Sqt2pin which requires: gengetopt libtokyocabinet-dev zlib1g-dev.
If you have sudo priviledges,issue the following command:
$ sudo apt-get install libxerces-c-dev libboost-dev build-essential cmake [gengetopt libtokyocabinet-dev zlib1g-dev]
If this is not the case, you will have to manually install programs and libraries.

Download the latest percolator_X_XX_src.tar.gz tar-ball. Issue the following command in the directory where the source bundle has been downloaded:
$ tar -zxvf percolator_[X]_src.tar.gz
Enter the unpacked directory and issue:
$ ./install/ubuntu_percolator[_converters].sh
The script will install the Percolator (and optionally the converters) binaries in the directory /tmp/percolatorInstall and run system tests.

Advanced users (and developers) may clone the project with Git by issuing:
$ git clone git://github.com/percolator/percolator
This will create a directory called "percolator"; Enter it and install as explained above.
