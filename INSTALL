Percolator, Qvality and Elude building and installation steps.

FOR LINUX USERS:

This package produces several executables: Qvality, Percolator and Elude.

The building process requires 'cmake' utility, which can be installed by
running command 'sudo apt-get install cmake'.

In order to build mentioned executables, run 'build_me.sh' building script (./build_me.sh)
which will create 'output' folder during out-of-source build.
The default target for building(what can be changed in this script) is 'install'
with 'Release' configuration.
Default installation directory on the target machine is '/usr/local/bin'.

After successfull building, executable files (for all mentioned executables) can be found
in created 'bin' directory (at the same level as 'src' folder).

In order to produce debug version of the code, parameter
'-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' should be given to cmake in building script file (build_me.sh),
for example: 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..'.

In order to compile the Google unit testing framework, please set variable GOOGLE_TEST in the 'build_me.sh'
to TRUE (you also need to install 'libgtest0' library).

In order to create source and distribution packages the following commands
should be executed in created 'output' folder(after running 'cmake ..' in this folder):
'sudo make package_source' and 'sudo make package' respectively. Created packages can be found
in same 'output' folder.

In order to commit .gitignore file among others, please instruct git to add it explicitly:
'git add -f .gitignore'

The commands `./percolator --help', `./qvality --help' or './elude --help'
in created 'bin' folder will display usage help.
